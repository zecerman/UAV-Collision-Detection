  One time configuration: If you do not yet have the Conda environment, you can install it using the environment.yml file in the root of our github and running:
conda env create -f environment.yml
  Training only works after activating the conda environment using:
conda activate Capstone
  To train, you must navigate to the directory 
cd .../UnityEnv
  Begin training with: 
mlagents-learn config/drone_goal.yaml --run-id=drone_goal_xxx 
  Resume training with:
mlagents-learn config/drone_goal.yaml --run-id=drone_goal_xx1 --initialize-from=drone_goal_xxx
